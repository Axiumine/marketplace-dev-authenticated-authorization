/*
 * The boot gate of ADR-034, against the real record in the real Redis.
 *
 * The whole point of moving the signing keys out of five environment files is that a service holding
 * the wrong key STOPS instead of starting and signing cookies its siblings cannot verify. That is a
 * property of the boot sequence, not of loadKeygrip — which is unit-tested against a fake store in
 * marketplace-common — so it is asserted here, where a real record written by globalSetup meets a
 * process that cannot open it.
 *
 * Its own file for the reason startFailure.itest.mts is: it needs a process with nothing connected
 * yet, and vitest gives each test file its own module registry, so the Redis singleton this closes on
 * the way out is not one another file is using.
